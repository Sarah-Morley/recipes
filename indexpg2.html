    <p style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(45, 90, 90); text-align: left; margin-right: 20; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium','Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Mushrooms are at their best when cooked over high heat, which makes them ideal for grilling. Toss them with more oil than you think is required and salt them only after they are cooked. As the mushrooms’ moisture disappears, their flavor concentrates and their outsides brown. Top with parsley, blue cheese and celery for the full Buffalo experience.</p><br>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
</div>
<!--adding line-height to lists with css class-->
<div class="ul-listspace">

    <ul>
    <li>1½ pounds medium to large mixed mushrooms such as<br> crimini, shiitake or maitake, or a combination, stemmed</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Buffalo-style hot sauce, such as Frank’s</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed and refrigerated</li>
    <li>1½ ounces firm blue cheese, sliced or crumbled</li>
    <li>A few sprigs of parsley</li>
    <li>3 stalks of celery, cut into 3 inch lengths </li>

    </ul></div>

<div>
    <h3>Preparation</h3> 
</div>

<div class="ol-listspace">
    <ol>
    <li>Heat all the burners of a gas grill, then off turn one of the end burners before cooking.</li>
<br>
    <li>While the grill is heating, place the mushrooms in a large bowl, and drizzle with olive oil. Put the hot sauce and garlic in a medium cast-iron skillet. </li>
<br>
    <li>When the grill is at about 450 degrees, add the mushrooms gill-side up over the flame. Cook the mushrooms, turning occasionally, until well browned and tender, 6 to 15 minutes. Close the lid between flips, listening and keeping an eye out for flare-ups. If liquid collects in the mushrooms while cooking, move them to an area of the grill without fire beneath to avoid flare-ups, then flip and return to direct heat.</li>
<br>
    <li>When the mushrooms are almost done, add the skillet to an area of the grill without flame beneath, so that there’s indirect heat. Add the mushrooms to the skillet as they finish. Season lightly with salt and add the butter, stirring to combine until glossy. Season to taste with salt, pepper and more hot sauce, then top with blue cheese and, if using, parsley.</li>

</ol>
